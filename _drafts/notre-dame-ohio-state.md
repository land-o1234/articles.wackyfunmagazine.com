Notre Dame's football team has been officially called the "Fighting Irish" since 1927 [^1] . There's no date for when the Ohio State team was first called the "Buckeyes". However, we do know that their mascot, Brutus Buckeye, was created in 1965[^2]. But why are these teams affectionately called these things by their fans?
