Notre Dame's football team has been officially called the "Fighting Irish" since 1927 [^1]. There's no date for when the Ohio State team was first called the "Buckeyes". However, we do know that their mascot, Brutus Buckeye, was created in 1965 [^2]. But why are these teams affectionately called these things by their fans? 

## Notre Dame "Fighting Irish"
The term "Fighting Irish" has a few possible origins according to the school's athletics page [^3].  The most popular has to do with Michigan, one of Notre Dame's rivals. During halftime of their game in 1909, Notre Dame was losing. One player didn't seem too happy about how they were playing. According to Notre Dame's website(s), he said to his teammates

> “What’s the matter with you guys? You’re all Irish and you’re not fighting worth a lick.”[^4]
