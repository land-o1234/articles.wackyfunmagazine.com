Notre Dame's football team has been officially called the "Fighting Irish" since 1927 [^1] .  There's no date for when the Ohio State team was first called the "Buckeyes". We do know that their mascot, Brutus Buckeye, was created in 1965. But why are these teams affectionatly called this by their fans?
