  bio: "Hi, I’m Jonah and I write articles for Wacky Fun magazine. I always thought writing was boring when I was a little kid, but recently found a passion for it in writing these articles. I don’t have any published works and am not currently writing any other than articles. If you like them, please let me know and I might consider writing a book or story. Thanks!"
