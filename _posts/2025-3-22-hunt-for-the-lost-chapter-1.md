&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natalie watched the various people mill around near the fireplace. The large room had a low, sloped ceiling which made the heat linger close to the floor. The main room was divided into three main sections: the entry, where the front door stood, the fireplace crackled, and the cozy furniture waited to receive guests; the dining room, where Natalie now sat, one of only four people in the back corner of the main area; and the check-in desk, which was a long stretch of wooden countertop that stood opposite the entry. She had never been inside the place before, but it was warm, and so she decided that she liked it. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She leaned back in her chair, relaxing her muscles. A few Shifters were among the people that crowded the inn's entry. Natalie noticed them instantly, which was easy as she was one herself, and marked them in her mind. She saw the humans move away from the Shifters, who were only seeking a place to warm up or rest like the other guests. Natalie thought back to when she had been just as afraid of them, those strange, alien people that everyone called Shifters. Now that she was one herself, she realized that the fear and resentment of Shifters that had been instilled in her was almost completely baseless. She had only been one for a little more than a year, but in that time she had met countless others and found that they were mostly just normal people—that could turn into animals whenever they wanted. She sighed. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="thought">They have one difference between them, humans and Shifters, and it's enough to make them monsters in the humans' eyes.</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natalie turned her back to the entryway and fireplace. The table before her was empty, just a plain, rough tabletop. Presently, her cousin, Leokah, picked his way through the throng of bodies, carrying two trays from the inn's cook. He arrived at the table and set one of the steaming vessels before her. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="dialog">"Thanks,"</span> she said before a yawn possessed her. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leokah nodded, seating himself across from his cousin. His head bobbed this way and that. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natalie inhaled deeply, licking her lips as the scent of the meaty stew permeated her nostrils. She began feasting on the hot meal; she used a spoon to scoop the tasty mixture into her mouth, albeit somewhat sloppily and most certainly ravenously. Her cousin held a piece of cheesebread before his face, occasionally darting his mouth forward to take a bite. Natalie almost laughed at how obvious he was being about being a Shifter. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="dialog">"What are you smiling about?"</span> Leokah asked after finishing half the bread. A cup of nuts sat untouched on his tray. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="dialog">"You just kinda look like a.. a chicken,"</span> she said, lowering her voice at the end. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="dialog">"Don't be ashamed of being a Shifter. Most of the humans at least tolerate us, and these people certainly don't care what we are."</span> He motioned at the swarm of humans that were all busy with their own affairs. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="dialog">"I guess you're right."</span> Natalie sighed. She pushed the empty bowl away, hearing its ceramic base scrape against the grain of the table. <span class="dialog">"I just don't wanna be the weird wolf Shifter. Most humans dislike wolves."</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leokah took another bobbing look around. <span class="dialog">"You think it's hard being a wolf? I'm a chicken! People would cut my head off and fry me up."</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natalie didn't answer. Leokah continued to peck at his dinner while the fire crackled ceaselessly. The humans ordered rooms for the night, bought meals to eat, and played games at some of the tables. Then one of the other Shifters rose from her seat and locked eyes with Natalie. She returned the stare, unafraid of the stranger with her cousin nearby. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The older girl moved forward, surprisingly graceful in the cramped room. In a moment, she had crossed to their table, sat down, and stretched back in her chair. Leokah swiveled his head to face the intruder. Natalie studied the stranger closely, not sensing any danger from her. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="dialog">"Well, I'm Adelle. Who are you two?"</span> She asked bluntly. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natalie didn't hear any anger or frustration in the other's voice; she just seemed like a very straightforward person. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="dialog">"I'm Natalie. Nice to meet you, Adelle."</span> She thrust a hand forward. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The older girl grabbed it, nodding approvingly, and gave her a firm squeeze. After a moment they both returned their hands to the table in front of them. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="dialog">"Howdy,"</span> Leokah said. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adelle raised her eyebrows. <span class="dialog">"Not a talker? Me neither. I'll find out your name later."</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="dialog">"He's Leokah, my cousin."</span> Natalie explained quickly. <span class="dialog">"And we're both—"</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="dialog">"Shifters."</span> Adelle interjected. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="dialog">"—Shifters,"</span> Natalie agreed. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="dialog">"I know. We can recognize each other. I saw you looking at us while you were sitting here."</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="dialog">"Us?"</span> Natalie glanced up and realized that another Shifter was standing behind Leokah. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leokah followed his cousin's gaze and suddenly spun to face the stranger, throwing his arms up as he did in a very birdlike manner. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The newcomer was younger than Leokah and merely smiled at his surprise. <span class="dialog">"Ssssmells like a chicken."</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leokah froze, ignoring the stares from the humans in the room. He quickly returned to his composed state again, pulling up a seat for the boy as he did. The younger boy slunk into his chair, leaning his head on his hand as he watched the cousins. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adelle rolled her eyes. <span class="dialog">"Don't act like a freak, Jakob. You're just a little rattlesnake."</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He blushed at her admonishment, averting his gaze. <span class="dialog">"A western diamondback rattlesnake. And I'm not little."</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natalie reached a hand forward and placed it on his shoulder. He turned back, focused on her face, and smiled slightly. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cousins briefly introduced themselves to Jakob. Since Adelle had provided his name and animal, robbing him completely of the ability to surprise either Natalie or Leokah, Jakob just nodded while they did. A moment of silence followed. No one spoke. All listened and studied one another. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="dialog">"Are you a chicken?"</span> Adelle asked casually, peering at the vanquished soup bowl. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="dialog">"Yes."</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adelle nodded thoughtfully. She turned to face Natalie. <span class="dialog">"You must be some kind of dog."</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="dialog">"Wolf actually."</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="dialog">"You told us he's a rattlesnake. What kind of Shifter are you, Adelle?"</span> Leokah probed suddenly. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adelle smiled. <span class="dialog">"Dragon,"</span> she admitted proudly. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natalie felt her eyes go wide. She had heard of dragons and had seen the shadow of one flying overhead once, but she had never really been up close to one. She had certainly never met a dragon Shifter. She felt a tingle in the back of her neck as the weight of Adelle's statement completely settled on her mind.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leokah, on the other hand, stayed calm. <span class="dialog">"Neat. Though, it must be lonely being the only dragon Shifter in like ten towns."</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adelle's face fell. Leokah had hit a sore spot. <span class="dialog">"Yeah,"</span> was all she managed. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire burst to renewed fury as the innkeeper dumped a basketful of coals onto the dying flame. A loud slam rang out as the kitchen door slammed shut for the night. Without a word, Jakob rose and grabbed the two trays off the table. As Jakob lifted his food away, Leokah opened his hand and plucked the bowl of nuts off of it. These he held and began popping into his mouth. A minute later Jakob returned without his burden. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing their meals, most of the humans went to their rooms or exited the inn. Now two humans sat on a couch by the fireplace, and one other snored in a cozy chair to their left. A single Shifter sat at a table close to the foursome, not eating, not resting, simply sitting. Natalie thought she appeared to be about Leokah's age—that being seventeen, since he had had his birthday only a month before. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="dialog">"What do you two want, anyway?"</span> Leokah asked. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="dialog">"Well, we kinda want your help."</span> Adelle said. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="dialog">"We need some extra arms and ears."</span> Jakob grinned at Leokah as he ate nuts monotonously. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="dialog">"What do you mean?"</span> Natalie questioned. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="dialog">"We're going on an adventure to help some humans. We need more people. You two would probably be exactly what we need."</span> Adelle elaborated. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="dialog">"What humans?"</span> Leokah set the bowl of nuts down in front of him. <span class="dialog">"And how would we benefit from this expedition?"</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adelle pointed to the couch where two humans sat alertly, appearing almost frightened. <span class="dialog">"That's who we're helping. We get a reward only if we succeed in bringing their sister home."</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="dialog">"What reward?"</span> Leokah stared evenly at Adelle. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="dialog">"Twenty acres of green hillside land on the foothills of Mount Thunder."</span> Adelle spoke slowly to reveal the huge proportions of the prize. <span class="dialog">"Split four ways, of course,"</span> she added hastily. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="dialog">"They don't have parents?"</span> Leokah asked. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="dialog">"Their mother died three years ago in the big fire over in Hillburg. Their father has to work their farm. It's amazing that he's offering twenty acres of rich, beautiful land on Mount Thunder just to bring their sister home."</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="dialog">"Did she run away or something?"</span> Natalie wondered what would make someone abandon her only family. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="dialog">"We don't know. We just have to bring her back. These humanssss are going to help us since they're her siblings."</span> Jakob explained. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="dialog">"I'm in,"</span> Leokah said firmly. <span class="dialog">"Natalie can choose for herself."</span> He waved his hand dismissively, contradicting his own words immediately. <span class="dialog">"She's young, and it might not be safe, anyway."</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="dialog">"I'm almost as old as this snake kid!"</span> Her voice rose with passion. <span class="dialog">"Count me in."</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adelle nodded again. She whistled, catching the attention of the humans on the couch. They looked at her, spoke to each other, and then came over. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natalie and Leokah gave them their names. They were then introduced to the boy, named Seth, and his sister, May. The brother was the younger one, Natalie could tell. The sister looked determined, though she was definitely wary of all the Shifters.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="thought">She's wary of me,</span> Natalie realized with a pang of sadness. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="dialog">"We have all we need."</span> Adelle said to May. <span class="dialog">"We're ready to go get your sister."</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="dialog">"Okay. Thank you for helping us."</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl's voice was soft but firm to Natalie's ears. She instantly liked her. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="dialog">"Wait. What happened to your sister? Did she run away or something?"</span> Leokah asked, standing. The nut bowl was in his hands again. His left hand absently dug into the little mix, turning the contents over and feeling them. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A shadow of grief passed over May's face. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natalie expected her to reveal that her sister had been taken by some awful thieves or kidnappers or something. However, the real answer was far worse than she had imagined. It made the task they had just agreed to perform seem impossible. May said, <span class="dialog">"She's a Lost."</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bowl of nuts fell to the ground with a clatter, sending the tiny things skittering all over the floor.
