### Note to the disappointed reader:
You probably didn’t see some of your favorite holiday movies like *Elf*, *Polar Express*, or the animated Grinch movie on my list. Let me explain. I hate Will Ferrell, and he is not funny compared to any good comedian—Robin Williams, Jim Carey, Jerry Seinfeld are all much funnier. *Polar Express* is boring, slow, and hard to follow. I like the animated Grinch movie, but I like the live-action better, and I was not putting remakes on the list.  
**Happy Holidays, disgruntled readers. Not sorry.**
