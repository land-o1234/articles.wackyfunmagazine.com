**Today, I shall review Mere Christianity by Clive Staples Lewis.**
This is a holiday book since it talks about the religion started by God, and His Son, Who gave us the
perfect example, and Who’s birthday the holidays celebrate.

The beautifully written piece starts at the basic level, and, step by logical step, brings you to the
conclusion that God is real, His Son died to pay for our sins, and He is the answer to the question of 
“What is the meaning of life?”

C.S. writes like no other. What more can I say? He constantly quotes famous Christian theologians to 
support his argument. He says many times how he is just a layman, and you should read the Bible for 
yourself and do your own research. Humbly preaching the gospel in a little less than 200 pages is quite a feat.

It is a wonderful read, especially for the holidays. Take the time this season to reflect on everything 
God has done for us. This book can help you see the full extent of His Mercy, and also the flaws in arguments 
that God isn’t real, doesn’t exist, or is evil. Cement your faith, and prepare to fight the good fight as Paul 
said with this work from one of the 20th Century’s greatest authors.
