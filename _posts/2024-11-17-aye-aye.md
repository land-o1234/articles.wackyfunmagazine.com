### What is an aye-aye?

The aye-aye is a large lemur that lives in the rainforests and jungles of Madagascar.
It the largest nocturnal primate and spends most of its time foraging for food. Its diet
consists mostly of insect larvae, but it will also eat plants when necessary. 

### Foraging for food

The really extraordinary thing about this animal is how it forages for food. These lemurs have an
extremely long and boney middle finger. Throughout the night, they climb through the
trees, tapping on branches with their middle finger. They do this to find hollow spots in
the wood where grubs would be hiding. Similar to a beaver, an aye-ayeâ€™s teeth never
stop growing. They gnaw a hole through the tree before using their middle finger to
reach inside and grab the larvae. Their foraging quest can start anywhere from 30
minutes to 3 hours after sunset. They can travel up to 2 1/2 miles in a single night.

### Territories

Since theyâ€™re primates, they spend most of their time about 70 meters up in the
treetops. They sleep in spherical nests made of twigs and leaves during the daytime. A
male aye-ayeâ€™s territory may take up as much as 80 acres. Their territories usually
overlap and though are considered solitary animals, get along well with each other and
will sometimes forage together. 

### Endangerment

The aye-aye is considered endangered because of
deforestation. It is estimated that there are only as few as 1,000 to 10,000 left in the
wild.
I hope youâ€™ve enjoyed some facts about an amazing animal.
