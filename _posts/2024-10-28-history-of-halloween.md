### Origins

Halloween was first celebrated 2,000 years ago. 

Back then people celebrated Samhain which was a Pagan festival that marked the end of summer and the harvest. 

They had bonfires that symbolized the sun and to cleanse the people and bring the god’s blessings. The Celts also believed that the bonfires would guide souls to the afterlife.

People also danced at Samhain festivals. 

The Celts wore costumes that looked like monsters and animals to avoid being taken by fairies and to confuse spirits.  

There were sacrifices of animals and crops to the Celtic deities. 

People made lanterns out of hallowed pumpkins. 

These are just many of the things they did at these festivals. 

### Present Traditions

Now a days kids dress up as scary things and cartoon people and go trick or treating in their or a friend’s neighborhood. 

We still have festivals, but they are nothing like what our ancestors had.

### Reformation Day

October 31st is also Reformation Day. 

Reformation Day is the day Martin Luther nailed the ninety-five theses to the door of a Catholic Church. 

These theses were points that Martin Luther made about how he thought the church had gone wrong.
